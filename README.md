# llm-fraud-detection
Robust semi-supervised fraud detection using Rust native NLP pipelines.
# About
**llm-fraud-detection** relies on [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to generate **text embeddings** from a given text to predict the fraud likelihood.

The training data is generated from a diverse collection of commonly used spam/ham datasets:
- Ling Spam,
- Enron Spam,
- Spam Assassin Dataset,
- SMS Spam Collection,
- Youtube Spam,
- Crypto Governance Proposals.

**llm-fraud-detection** archives state-of-the-art performance without fine tuning the LLMs directly, instead the outputs of the LLMs (embeddings) are trained on and used for the spam/ham classification task.

# Use

Git clone and train the required models. Edit the docker-compose.yml first.

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
(the training data is provided in this repository, the models are not due to size limitations)

Add to your `Cargo.toml` manifest:

```ini
[dependencies]
rust_fraud_detection_tools = { git="https://github.com/Philipp-Sc/llm-fraud-detection.git" }
```

Predict fraud/ham:
```rust

pub const SENTENCES: [&str;6] = [
    "Lose up to 19% weight. Special promotion on our new weightloss.",
    "Hi Bob, can you send me your machine learning homework?",
    "Don't forget our special promotion: -30% on men shoes, only today!",
    "Hi Bob, don't forget our meeting today at 4pm.",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL: LAST TERRA PHOENIX AIRDROP üåé ‚úÖ CLAIM NOW All participants in this vote will receive a reward..",
    "Social KYC oracle (TYC)  PFC is asking for 20k Luna to build a social KYC protocol.."
    ];


fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {

    let fraud_probabilities: Vec<f32> = rust_fraud_detection_tools::fraud_probabilities(&SENTENCES)?;
    println!("Predictions:\n{:?}",fraud_probabilities);
    println!("Labels:\n[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]");
    Ok(())
}

```
```
Predictions:
[1.0, 0.0, 0.6536912, 0.0, 0.99759775, 0.17467633]
Labels:
[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
```

This project is part of [CosmosRustBot](https://github.com/Philipp-Sc/cosmos-rust-bot), which provides Governance Proposal Notifications for Cosmos Blockchains. The goal is automatically detect fraudulent and deceitful proposals to prevent users falling for crypto scams. The current model is very effective in detecting fake governance proposals.
